What's new in V0.2.5
--------------------

- Calibration tool: Improved Magnetometer calibration

API Changes:
- Reading of absolute raw sensor values (accel, gyro and mag) now exposed in OVRDevice.cs:
    GetAcceleration
    GetAngularVelocity
    GetMagnetometer

- Removed AccelGain field from OVRDevices

- Removed Magnetometer calibration

Defects Fixed in V0.2.5:
- Properties fields added to OVRCameraController in V0.2.4 were not correctly saved with scene file. 

Known Defects in V0.2.5:
- (none)

--------------------

What's new in V0.2.4
--------------------
NOTE: Latest Unity build required (4.2.0) 

Linux (Ubuntu 32 and 64 bit) support, including joypad control (XBox wired and wireless).

Antialiasing (MSAA) of render targets are now available (new in 0.4.2)

Unity will now use magnetometer calibration from the calibration tool if it exists.

Ability to keep tracker from resetting when loading scenes, which allows orientation to be maintained
across scene loading.

Many of the member variables in OVRCamera have been converted to properties, which allows them to be changed on fly. 
This includes the following variables:

Vertical FOV
IPD
Background Color
Near / Far Clip Plane

--------------------

What's new in V0.2.3
--------------------
New Tuscany assets! NOTE: Latest Unity build required (4.1.3) 

Oculus Config Tool added to all packages: User can set IPD and Player Eye Height in Oculus Config Tool

'UsePlayerEyeHeight' bool added in OVRCameraController; If set, will use player height set in Oculus Config Tool 

Manual magnetometer calibration mode has been updated to be more robust 

Bug fix to C# messaging system; error messages in console will not show up, delegate names changed to avoid name clashes

Fixed an OSX gamepad controller bug, causing editor to crash when trying to add an OVRPlayerController

FIxed a rare bug where the right camera would render and stay completely white; issue has been fixed for Win and Mac

Crosshair rendering is now done on main 3D menu display target 

Minor code refactor

--------------------

What's new in V0.2.2
--------------------
Added magnetometer yaw-drift correction (manual and automatic modes)

Added detection of sensor plugging and unplugging (for tracker, HMD and latency tester)

Added native support for game-pad controllers on Mac (currently PS3 and Logitech wireless F710)

Fixed Mac 10.6 compatability issue; required libstdc++ to be used to avoid a 'black screen' crash

Changed main menu HUD to be rendered in 3D

Fixed skybox to render properly on MacOS

Functions in OVRCameraController to attach objects to the camera for the use of HUD elements

Enhanced inspector view for OVRCameraController component

Minor bug fixes and code refactor


--------------------

What's new in V0.2.1
--------------------

Added functions in OVRCameraController to get orientation of tracker 
(GetCameraOrientationEulerAngles and GetCameraOrientation)

Exposed the following members in OVRCameraController:

 PredictionOn
 CallInPreRender
 WireMode
 LensCorrection
 Chromatic 
 (please read Unity Integration Guide for usage of the above)
 
64-bit Windows build supported 

MacOS support

Deferred rendering shadow fix

Chromatic Abberation fix in lens warp shader

Fixed projection center to lens distortion center, decoupling IPD from projection center

Bug fixes and code refactoring

--------------------

V0.1.5
--------------------

Initial release of Oculus Unity integration.
